      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am originally from a small town in Assam, northeastern India. Assam is known for Assam Tea, One horn Rhino, Muga Silk, and Petrochemicals. Panhandle Research, Extension, Education & Research Center gave me a home for my curiosity about science and soil. I primarily work with soil, microbes, management, and data science to understand soil health. Nebraska, as a state, provides a perfect experimental platform with wide variability in precipitation, topology, and soil to understand how climatic variabilities and management effects the soil health status. For the broad adoption of soil health management, I believe a few critical questions need to be answered in soil health management. In an effort, we have developed Soil Health Gap and Cropland Reference Ecological Unit concepts and working on a few critical questions and ideas. Please contact me if you have questions about Soil Health, Management, Assessment, Carbon, and Microbes. We are also working on different aspects of rangeland management, integrating with soil health. I am open to potential collaboration in research, especially in soil health, soil microbes, and plant-microbe interactions.</p>
